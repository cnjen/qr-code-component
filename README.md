## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'm still in the early stages of learning HTML and CSS, but some things I noticed, that I need to learn more about/feel more comfortable with, would be:
- responsive layouts 
- size units 
- flexbox
- inheritance

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/233004-day-1-using-percentages-avoiding-heights/678543-percentages-vs-fixed-widths) - Taught me a bit about width in responsive layouts, but I still need to learn more about this.
- [Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/_-aDOAMmDHI) - Same as above, it taught me some things, but I need to learn more about it/work with it more, to get better at it.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_center-vertical.asp) - Used this to center the card, but I'm not sure it was the correct solution/best practice.
